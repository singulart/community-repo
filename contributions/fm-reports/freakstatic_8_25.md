Summary:   
- Discord   
       I was very active on the Discord, in various channels, with more than 3000 messages in total.   
   
- Storage Provider   
       I kept running a storage provider (ID: 3 5C8BEb4AwVmDnxkZmbh4PVxJR5TMQ7QxU6nZtYkqTAvXhUP3) together with l1dev.    
   
- Operations Worker      
       Maintained the nodes for the wss://joystreamstats.live:9945 endpoint (also together with l1dev).       
       Helped the operations workers with tech questions (I have became the operations Mentor pretty much because of that https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/1040).        
       Worked on scripts for the council and SPs.   
       Performance improvements on pioneer.   
       Bounty Manager of the bounty #21 - joystream.org translation.   
   
- Council       
My work in the council can be resumed in:          
       Analysing proposals and vote on them (I also made a few proposals linked in each scoring period below).        
       Some forum discussions.      
       Creating council and tokenomics reports.      
       Made at least 2 council budgets.     
       I was the council secretary or the council deputy a few times already.      
   
- Validator      
       I was also a very active validator but that doesn't matter much...
