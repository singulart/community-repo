Due to migration, 4,821 videos were moved during the reporting period on January 26. The leader compared the data with previous reports and removed duplicates, resulting in 814 videos that needed to be checked.  
814 videos were verified by the curators. Each curator checked 117 videos - it was a challenging week, but the tasks assigned were fully accomplished.  
jen4ph, kiraa, igrex, spat_sochi, mmsaww, arseniy2706 added comments to the video.  
kiraa helped check out the Igrex remaining videos, great work as always.  
jen4ph collected statistics on poorly rated videos in Bounty 18 and tabulated them. This is necessary for newcomers to see and correct their mistakes and make quality videos. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VmOGKtxtPXP79Z6GFP_-JeElpfUPtlrW/edit#gid=262648852
